Social Media Analysis Dashboard – From Raw Data to Insights!

I recently analyzed a dataset of social media posts across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter 📊

Here’s what I discovered:

🧠 Sentiment Analysis helped measure audience mood

🎯 Video posts generated the highest engagement 📈

📅 Weekends, especially Saturday, had the most activity

Tools used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables + Charts + Dashboarding) 💻

Building this helped me understand how data can drive real content strategies.
